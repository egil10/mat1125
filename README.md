# MAT1125 – Advanced Linear Algebra

Repository for course materials, assignments, and resources for **MAT1125 – Advanced Linear Algebra** at the University of Oslo.

**Course Information:** [MAT1125 Course Page](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT1125/index-eng.html)

## Course Description

MAT1125 – Advanced Linear Algebra expands on the knowledge of linear algebra from MAT1105 – Linear Algebra and Numerical Methods, and is a natural continuation of this course. The course covers advanced topics in linear algebra with applications to data analysis and functional analysis.

## Course Content

This course covers the following topics:

- Inner products and orthogonality
- The method of least squares
- Spectral theory
- The singular value decomposition (SVD) and applications to analysis of large data sets
- Abstract and normed vector spaces
- Basis, dimension and subspaces
- Examples of infinite dimensional normed vector spaces, such as the set of continuous functions with the supremum norm
- Inner product spaces and basic theory for these
- Fourier series

## Prerequisites

**Recommended previous knowledge:**
- MAT1100 – Calculus
- MAT1105 – Linear Algebra and Numerical Methods
